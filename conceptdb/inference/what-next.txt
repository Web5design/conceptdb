Let's simplify the problem. We have a mostly-bipartite multigraph of things we
might believe, and (conjunctions of) reasons to believe them.

To apply the SALSA random-walk idea to this:

- Calculate the weights of all incoming/outgoing links here. Apply the
  "parallel divide" function for conjunctions using the *hub scores* of the
  nodes.
- Choose a link (with a given weight). It actually doesn't matter whether the
  link goes in or out; unlike SALSA, we don't need to alternate.
- Repeat for an arbitrary number of steps (probability *p* of quitting),
  and for each node.
- The hub score is the number of backward steps you took into a node. The
  authority score is the number of forward steps you took into a node.
- After running a walk from each node, update the hub scores for conjunctions.
  Then repeat.

Scale invariance:

- All hub scores start at 1, arbitrarily.
- When calculating conjunctions, use (my hub score || other hub score) / (my
  hub score), which puts them on a scale from 0 to 1. For a 2-node conjunction,
  that's (other / (me + other)).

TODO: Reduce this to a matrix equation and try to show that it converges.
