In many networks, including webs of trust, link graphs on the Web, and
semantically-linked knowledge bases, we wish to extract reliable information in
the presence of unreliable nodes. CORONA, for Computation of Reliability of
Networked Agents, is an unsupervised algorithm that calculates the reliability
of each node in a graph, where some nodes represent possibly-unreliable agents
that produce justifications for (or against) the reliability of other nodes.
Going beyond similar algorithms such as PageRank, it allows for conjunctions
and negations in addition to disjunctions in the graph, representing
information that depends on the reliability of multiple agents, or information
about which different agents actively disagree. In effect, it fuses the notions
of a web of trust and an inexact truth-maintenance system. It can be
implemented either with iterative updates on a graph or by converging to an
eigenvector defined by the graph. In this paper, I examine the effectiveness of
this algorithm on various test graphs, and then on a large justification graph
derived from the collaborative knowledge base ConceptNet.
